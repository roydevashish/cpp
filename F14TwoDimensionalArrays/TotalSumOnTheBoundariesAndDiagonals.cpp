Title: Total Sum on the Boundaries and Diagonals

Problem statement
You are given a two-dimensional square matrix of size NÃ—N. You need to find the sum of the elements on:
    1. The main diagonal (from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner).
    2. The secondary diagonal (from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner).
    3. All the boundary elements of the matrix
Make sure that no element is counted more than once, even if it belongs to both diagonals or is a boundary 
element. Your task is to compute the sum of all these unique elements.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Input format:
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then 
the test cases follow.
First line of each test case or query contains a single integer value, 'N' representing the 'rows' and 
'columns' for the two-dimensional square matrix.
Second line onwards, the next 'N' lines or rows represent the ith row values.
Each of the ith row constitutes 'N' column values separated by a single space.

Output format:
For each test case, print the single integer denoting the sum.
Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^3

Time Limit: 1sec

Sample input 1:
1
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Sample Output 1:
45

Explanation for Sample Output 1:
The boundary elements are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7 and 4. 
The first-diagonal elements are 1, 5 and 9. 
The second-diagonal elements are 3, 5 and 7.
We just need to add all these numbers making sure that no number is added twice. For example, '1' is 
both a boundary element and a first-diagonal element similarly, '5' contributes to both the diagonals 
but they won't be added twice.
Hence, we add up, [1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 5] to give 45 as the output.

Sample input 2:

5
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25
4
1 2 3 10
4 5 6 11
7 8 9 12
13 14 15 16

Sample Output 2:
